Instead of using the full git workflow, everyone can have their own folder.

#### Fist, clone the repo

Clone to local &mdash; only do this once.

```
git clone https://github.com/apclarkva/tadpole-project.git
```

#### Commands for pulling, editing, and pushing to the repository

1. After cloning, when starting a new session

```
git pull
```
At this point, you can start making changes on your local machine. 

2. When you're adding and changing things.

```
git add .
git commit -m "SHORT MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT YOU DID"
```

3. Push your repository to GitHub

```
git push
```
